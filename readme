So we use a queue here where we continue until there are no more nodes to process. We determine the numver of nodes at the current level then create an empty list to store all values of the node at the current level. We loop over each node at the current level and remove the front node from queue. Add its value to level value and add its left and right child to queu. After all nodes at the current level, if its not empty then we add it to the result list. Once the queue is empty the loop ends and the function returns result.
